# Small N Stats Data Tracker (Qt)

Data Tracker is a Qt-based application that assists researchers and clinicians in reliably measuring behavior of interest. This program can be used by multiple observers to record, and compare, behavior in real-time. Additionally, this tool provides multiples methods for assessing the reliability of measurements, session-by-session viewing and interpretation, and the automation of clinical responsibilities.

Features include:
  - Cross-platform support for Windows, Mac, and Linux (only Ubuntu tested)
  - Customizable methods for designing measurement systems
  - Real-time recording of behavior with multiple observers
  - Tools for calculation of reliability indices
  - Optionally automate reliability measures and reports as new data is added
  - Automated update delivery, for keeping up to date with new features and bug fixes
  - Options for saving behavioral data in multiple locations and formats (JSON, xlsx, etc.)
  - Saving figures and reports in a range of common formats
